# Dissertation-code

This contains much of my code for my dissertation. Each individual folder contains a README file that explains 
the files in that folder. Two R packages are associated with this research. They are EZtune and gwas3. EZtune is 
now available on CRAN, but gwas3 has not been submitted yet. It can be downloaded from github using the following 
commanes: 

library(devtools)
install_github("jillbo1000/gwas3")
